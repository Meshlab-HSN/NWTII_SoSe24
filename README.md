...our seminar/lecture repository of the networking group MeshLab @HS-Nordhausen


# Network technology (NWT) SoSe 24
Repo for the 'Network technology' seminar course in summer semester 2024

MeshLab - Networking Seminar & Material   
This repository provides sofware tools and documentation used in the Networking courses at HSN (Nordhausen - University of Applied Sciences). To create, configure, run and troubleshoot different network experiments a virtual machine (VM) based on OpenWrt Linux is used.

# SSH keys

In `ssh_keys.yaml` we will collect public SSH keys from you to provide you with a virtual machine running OpenWrt and access to it via private-public key authentication. See the file on how to add your SSH key to the list.
